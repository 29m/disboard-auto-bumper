## Installing

Clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com/29m/disboard-auto-bumper`

# Getting Started

This project is written in Discord.js, you must make sure when you install that you are using any version below 12, or else your token will error invalid. I may not be fast to respond to issues if you create them, but I will try my best! Just make sure when you install Discord.js it is version ``11.6.4`` or below!

## Usage

1. Clone this repository as stated above.
2. `npm i discord.js@11.6.4` or any version lower. Any version above blocks your token.
3. Open the config.json file and edit the information accordingly.
4. [Find your Discord token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI)
5. In the main directory open the command prompt and to run the bot: `node index.js`.
